## Project Overview
* This project aims to develop a machine learning system that estimates the fair market value of used vehicles based on structured listing data.
* The goal is to build the solution as a complete engineering pipeline — from business understanding and data validation to model training, evaluation, and deployment readiness.
* The final deliverable will include a lightweight one-page web application where users can input vehicle characteristics and receive a real-time price estimate. The interface may also display key model evaluation metrics to provide transparency into prediction performance.
